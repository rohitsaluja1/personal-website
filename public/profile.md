## About
I've always seen technology as an instrument of change. With recent advancements in AI and the newfound ability to create and scale intelligence, I firmly believe we are witnessing the biggest breakthrough ever, not just in technology. I am determined to leverage AI for large-scale impacts and play a small role in creating a society of abundance in the upcoming decades.

## Work Experience
- **Head of AI** | RightHub | Stockholm, Sweden
  - Helping build the future of Intellectual Property with AI.

- **AI Engineer** | AMD Silo AI *(now part of AMD)* | Helsinki, Finland
  - Silo AI is Europe's largest private AI lab. I led projects in Generative AI.

- **Founding AI Engineer & Research Lead** | Flowrite *(now part of MailMaestro)* | Helsinki, Finland
  - Joined as Engineer/Employee #1. Worked extensively with all things related to large language models like GPT-3, from leveraging their generation capabilities to build conversational AI agents to creating custom metrics to fight against their stochasticity. Also thoroughly explored the new paradigm of prompt engineering.

- **AI Researcher** | Aalto University | Espoo, Finland
  - Wrote the python implementation for the the library of the model agnostic explainable AI (XAI) algorithm called Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) under the supervision of Dr. Kary Främling.

- **Machine Learning Researcher** | Aalto University | Espoo, Finland
  - Explainable AI (XAI) for medical medical images derived from the wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) procedure. The objective of the project was to build a decision making support.

- **Co-founder** | FOODL | Espoo, Finland
  - Build the largest food-sharing platform at Aalto University in Finland. The platform was open-sourced and is now run by community voluteers. I've moved to a more passive role.

- **Data Scientist – Thesis Worker** | Futurice | Helsinki, Finland
  - Time series forecasting and explainable AI (XAI) for mutivariate time series forecating model to extract actionable insigts for sales strategy.

- **ML Engineer - Internship** | Aalto University | Helsinki, Finland
  - Built an IT support ticket classifer POC for IT services department to help expedite the customer support service process by roughly 50%.

- **Co-founder and ML Developer** | NeuroGuard | Berkeley, California
  - An attempt at personalized diagnostics for brain tumors patients.

- **Co-founder and CEO** | QB Middle East
