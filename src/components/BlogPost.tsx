            <p>The hype around Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still going strong in October 2024, especially with Nobels awarded to Demis Hassabis, Chemistry and Geoffrey Hinton, Physics. Besides, almost everyone in big tech and startup circles seems to be obsessed with AI. This hype train started with the launch of ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI in November 2022, as it spawned a new era of Generative AI with large language models (LLMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and (audio or image) diffusion models.</p>
            
            <p>A lot of people want to capitalize on these GenAI technologies, and have built startups that are wrappers on GPTs, Claudes, or other proprietary LLMs (large language models). These AI wrapper startups are sometimes criticized for being "copies" or "thin layers" over existing foundational models like GPT-4 or Claude.</p>
            
            <p>Before jumping to any conclusions, let's break it down a bit more.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">But first, what is an AI Wrapper?</h2>
            
            <p>A wrapper is usually a software application which allows a user to interact with core technology from a user-friendly interface. A popular example is Cursor AI.</p>
            
            <p>Functionally, a wrapper abstracts intricacies, as it eats up the complexity of using a sophisticated technology, making it simple to understand and easier to work with. It helps a user leverage a technology without actually needing to understand its inner workings.</p>
            
            <p>A wrapper technology is exactly how it sounds. It packs a core technology (such as LLMs) in an appealing, user-oriented UI, removing complexity of handling the underlying technology. Thus, the wrapper application becomes quite user friendly.</p>
            
            <p>AI wrapper startups build a wrapper (software) on top of foundational models to readily provide AI capabilities in its product. With such wrappers, you don't have to understand what the AI is doing, yet you can still harness its power. Furthermore, a wrapper product can be classified into two types -thin and thick:</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Thin wrapper product:</h3>
            
            <p>An application that builds one or two new features over a core technology (such as LLMs, or cloud infrastructure). Usually, thin wrappers call APIs of the technology they're built up on, to perform certain tasks and are packaged inside attractive, user-friendly UIs. They generally offer a lower barrier of entry to a startup but may lack major differentiation and competitive advantage.</p>
            
            <p>(a) Foundation models such as GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 by OpenAI, Llama3 by Meta (b) Cloud infrastructure services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), GCP (Google Cloud Platform) (c) Operating systems like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android are few examples of core technologies</p>
            
            <p>Jasper AI and Copy AI are AI copywriting tools that uses OpenAI's language models to generate marketing copy like ads, emails, and blog posts. It provides a user interface on top of the underlying AI capabilities.</p>
            
            <p>ChatPDF and PDFgear chatbot are tools that allow conversational style of querying. Thus, upgrading the traditional Ctrl+F (find) function. Both of them leverage LLM APIs from OpenAI to allow interaction with pdfs.</p>
            
            <p>Kickresume offers AI resume builder that's powered by GPT-4. Then there are open-source projects such as CV_Improver_with_LLMs, that wraps around LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere, or Google.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Thick wrapper products:</h3>
            
            <p>An application that clubs a core technology with additional proprietary work to produce a significant value proposition for a specific use case, can be considered a thick wrapper product. A thick wrapper offers unique features with an enhanced user experience to create a competitive edge for a startup.</p>
            
            <p>Wrappers are like pearls. If a startup can make it work, it keeps depositing newer layers of customised features on top of the core technology until they become a thick wrapper of indispensable value.</p>
            
            <p>Zapier is a product to solve workflow automation. Zapier Copilot is an assistant that wraps around an LLM to deliver suggestions on how to navigate Zapier for any situation a user prompts for. This cuts the time to dive into a big step-by-step tutorial, solving a unique use-case specific within Zapier ecosystem.</p>
            
            <p>Perplexity AI is popular initial entrant in the question-answer based web search space. It wrapped around GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in its early days (up until it developed its own proprietary LLMs), with proprietary ranking (for search results) and fact-checking (for verifying information) algorithms. This made it a thick wrapper for web-search.</p>
            
            <p>GitHub Copilot and Cursor AI are examples of thick wrapper products that help developers and programmers with code auto completion, error detection, and debugging with just plain English prompts. GitHub Copilot is wrapped around OpenAI's codex, preceding even ChatGPT-3.5. Cursor AI allows the user to choose from multiple LLMs available in the market.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Now that we understand what a thick and thin wrapper is, let's address why do AI wrapper companies receive flak for being a thin wrapper?</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Thin AI Wrappers, a ticking time bomb</h3>
            
            <p>Many foundational AI companies believe that they will end up cannibalizing thin wrapper startups soon enough, once they release upgraded AI models. Thin AI wrapper startups receive heavy criticism because of this assumption.</p>
            
            <p>Sundar Pichai (CEO Google) advised that instead of using a thin or shallow wrapper, companies should use thick wrappers that add real value or solve real-world problems on a podcast. Earlier, Sam Altman (CEO OpenAI) said in a podcast, that his company will steamroll any startup or product that uses GPT-4. He has also repeatedly urged startups to build solutions inherently adaptable to rapidly evolving GenAI. Founders should think beyond current AI capabilities to focus on solutions that address future generalizability, according to Altman.</p>
            
            <p>Altman's claim is not entirely unfounded. Perplexity AI already faces a stiff competition from OpenAI since September 2023, when ChatGPT was upgraded with an ability to browse the web. Perplexity then upgraded to its proprietary LLM in its free version just after a month, to eliminate the dependency on a direct competitor. OpenAI has decided to go all in with SearchGPT prototype in 2024.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>While the threat of shutdown may turn out to be true for some of the startups, it is still a speculation rather than a prophecy set in stone at this point.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Now that we have discussed the risks associated with thin wrappers, let's travel into the past.</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Tracing Wrapper's journey in time</h3>
            
            <p>You might be blown away to learn that programmers and developers were not only familiar with the concept of wrappers, but also have been using it for decades now. Let's understand how.</p>
            
            <p>In 2008, GitHub API came out, that allowed developers to interact with GitHub in a programmatic fashion. After five years, PyGitHub was launched. PyGitHub is a pythonic wrapper, allowing Python programs to easily interact with the GitHub API.</p>
            
            <p>If you have dealt with image processing, you might have come across library wrappers like cv2 in Python. It allows the use of OpenCV's (launched in 2000), capabilities from Python, without writing any C++ code. Thus, cv2 is a thin wrapper (also called a binding) around the core C++ codebase.</p>
            
            <p>Assembly language (first documented in 1947) is a thin wrapper around machine code. Assembly language forms the basis of many languages such as C (1972), C++ (1983), Java (1995). These languages act as a thick wrapper over assembly language.</p>
            
            <p>Cloud providers offer APIs for their services wrapped by various tools, frameworks, and products. This allows developers to integrate cloud functionality into their applications easily, without needing deep expertise in the underlying cloud technologies. For example, Heroku is a thick wrapper over AWS, whereas PaaS like Render or Railway wrap around multiple cloud infrastructure providers (GCP, AWS, etc.)</p>
            
            <p>History is a witness, that some startups which initially started as a thin wrapper not only survived by evolving into something better, sometimes even thrived and became the most popular products. Let's look at some of them.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Wrappers can survive and thrive!</h3>
            
            <p>Slack started as a thin wrapper over some open chat protocols. Now it offers team collaboration tools, file sharing, integration with almost every popular tool thus evolving into a full-fledged team collaboration tool.</p>
            
            <p>Twitter began as a thin wrapper over text messaging. It added features like likes, retweets, and real-time public conversations, evolving into a global social media platform uniquely suited for viral trends and breaking news.</p>
            
            <p>Notion began as a thin interface over a website tech stack, to offer web page building. It kept on upgrading with addition of databases, task or project management, and collaboration tools, and now even a native AI assistant, eventually becoming an all-rounder workspace suite for the modern digital environment.</p>
            
            <p>As evident it might be, it still needs to be said that wrappers help people utilize and commoditize the underlying API or foundational technology instead of starting from scratch. This saves time and effort allowing people and by extension startups to build complex products that solve real world problem.</p>
            
            <p>We think that it is a matter of time to see which AI wrapper startups evolve to become the definitions of GenAI success, and which ones unfortunately kick the dust. One thing seems sure, without continuous innovation, deeper understanding of user needs, and building proprietary technology, survival won't be possible. Regardless of the risks, the ones with a zeal to build should keep trying till they succeed.</p>
